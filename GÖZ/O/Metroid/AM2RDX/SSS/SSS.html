<h2 id=versionplatform-questions>Version/Platform Questions</h2>
<h4 id=what-is-the-latest-available-version>What is the latest available version?</h4>
<p>The current version is 1.5.5 and can be installed with the AM2RLauncher.</p>
<h4 id=do-different-platforms-have-different-versions-or-content>Do different platforms have different versions or content?</h4>
<p>The latest available version is released on all supported platforms (see next question) and can be installed via the AM2RLauncher. Main game content differs between versions (1.3 versus 1.5, for example), but not between different platforms within the same version - with the exception of platform-specific limitations like custom file loading on Android.</p>
<h4 id=what-are-the-currently-supported-platforms>What are the currently supported platforms?</h4>
<p>Windows, Android, and Linux (x86).</p>
<h4 id=what-are-the-minimum-specifications-to-play-am2r-on-a-pc>What are the minimum specifications to play AM2R on a PC?</h4>
<p>An AMD E-300 APU with Radeon HD Graphics and 3GB of RAM should give you fullspeed for the whole game assuming you play on 4:3 and have custom palettes disabled, with some slight stuttering for X Parasite morphing.<br>
If you have perfomance problems on Windows, be sure to check out the question “<a href=#am2r-runs-slow-on-windows-way-slower-than-previous-versions>AM2R runs slow on Windows!</a>”.<br>
Chromebooks will need higher requirements if you’re using Linux (Beta)/Crostini.</p>
<h4 id=what-are-the-minimum-specifications-for-android>What are the minimum specifications for Android?</h4>
<ul>
 <li>Quad-core 1.2Ghz CPU</li>
 <li>Dedicated GPU</li>
 <li>2GB RAM</li>
</ul>
<p>These specs will provide full-speed gameplay almost everywhere, with some slowdowns in non-critial areas with a large amount of objects, such as the main caverns of Area 2, Area 3, and Area 5. Weaker GPUs may slow down in Fusion difficulty during X Parasite morphing.</p>
<h4 id=where-can-i-stay-up-to-date-on-am2r>Where can I stay up-to-date on AM2R?</h4>
<ul>
 <li><a href=https://metroid2remake.blogspot.com/>DoctorM64’s AM2R blog</a> - Original AM2R blog by DoctorM64. DoctorM64 and the rest of the original AM2R development team have no association with the Community Updates.</li>
 <li><a href=https://reddit.com/r/AM2R>Reddit</a> - The official AM2R Subreddit.</li>
 <li><a href=https://discord.gg/YTQnkAJ>Discord</a> and <a href=https://matrix.to/#/#am2r:matrix.org>Matrix</a> - The official AM2R Server/Space, both of which are bridged together.</li>
 <li><a href=https://youtube.com/c/am2rcommunityupdates>YouTube</a> - The official AM2R Community Updates YouTube channel.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id=can-i-play-am2r-on-a-mac>Can I play AM2R on a Mac?</h4>
<p>Macs are not officially supported. There is however, an unofficial port available here: <a href=https://github.com/Miepee/AM2R-Autopatcher-Mac>https://github.com/Miepee/AM2R-Autopatcher-Mac</a></p>
<p>If you’re unable to use that, M1 and x64-based Macs are reportedly able to run AM2R via Crossover, and for older Macs an x86-based system may be able to run AM2R via Wine/Wineskin or through a VM. Keep in mind however, that those solutions will be significantly slower than running it natively.<br>
Alternatively, you can also use Bootcamp on x64-based Macs in order to run the Windows version of AM2R.</p>
<h4 id=can-i-play-am2r-on-ios>Can I play AM2R on iOS?</h4>
<p>AM2R cannot be run on iOS.</p>
<h4 id=can-i-play-am2r-on-a-chromebook>Can I play AM2R on a Chromebook?</h4>
<p>You have four options:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Use a VM. This is NOT recommended, as Chromebooks are notoriously weak/slow devices.</li>
 <li>Install the Android version of AM2R on your Chromebook. This <strong>requires a controller</strong> in order to play. Keyboard controls will not currently work.</li>
 <li>Install the Linux version of AM2R on your Chromebook via Crostini. This <strong>requires an x86 based</strong> Chromebook and you need to have Crostini/Linux (Beta) enabled on your device. For more details, check the Linux Installation Guide further down.</li>
 <li>Install a Linux distro onto your Chromebook, and use the native Linux version. This will lead to better performance, should you struggle with the option above, but only works with select Chromebooks. See this for more details: <a href=https://wiki.galliumos.org/Hardware_Compatibility>https://wiki.galliumos.org/Hardware_Compatibility</a></li>
</ul>
<h4 id=can-i-play-am2r-on-the-switchplaystation-vita>Can I play AM2R on the Switch/PlayStation Vita?</h4>
<p>The Switch and PlayStation Vita are not supported platforms. Ports of the Community Updates for these platforms have been made by third parties, but they were created with pirated development tools and violated SDK NDAs; as such every support question regarding them will be deleted, and may result in a ban from our communication channels.</p>
<h4 id=gamemaker-studio-14-has-a-playstation-vita-export-module-why-cant-you-make-a-build>GameMaker: Studio 1.4 has a PlayStation Vita export module. Why can’t you make a build?</h4>
<p>That module was discontinued before any of the developers on our team could legitimately obtain a copy. Somebody else who already has the module could export the game, but we can’t officially support it as we don’t have firsthand access and are unsure of the legal concerns surrounding the Sony developer agreement.</p>
<h4 id=can-i-play-am2r-on-third-party-handheld-emulation-device>Can I play AM2R on [third-party handheld emulation device]?</h4>
<p>If it is running Android or x86-based Linux, you can probably install the respective version of AM2R. However, these devices are not officially supported as they often use highly specialized versions of Android and Linux.</p>
<h4 id=can-i-play-am2r-on-arm-linux-devices>Can I play AM2R on ARM Linux devices?</h4>
<p>ARM Linux is officially unsupported, as the Game Maker: Studio version we use does not have ARM Linux Support.<br>
However, there is a community made tool that allows you to run Android Games on ARM Linux, which you can check out here: <a href=https://github.com/JohnnyonFlame/droidports>https://github.com/JohnnyonFlame/droidports</a><br>
A guide on how to use it can be found in this Reddit post, along with some answered FAQ in the comments: <a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/AM2R/comments/pgp2x7/am2r_raspberry_pi_take_4/>https://www.reddit.com/r/AM2R/comments/pgp2x7/am2r_raspberry_pi_take_4/</a></p>
<h4 id=how-is-am2r-still-being-updated-didnt-the-developers-get-a-dmca>How is AM2R still being updated? Didn’t the developers get a DMCA?</h4>
<p>After the DMCA back in 2016 the original team ceased development. However, a talented programmer named YellowAfterlife reconstructed the source code in about 4 months.<br>
That source was eventually released to the public and a few members of the community took it upon themselves to release a “community patch” to fix some major bugs in the game. Eventually that one update became multiple bug fix patches, until eventually it started to add some content that was planned by the original devs before the DMCA.<br>
Things like New Game+ and Random Game+ modes were added, along with the planned secret ending, widescreen and eventually Fusion Difficulty!<br>
For almost 5 years now we’ve been adding content like some of the creatures that didn’t make it from the original Metroid II, fixing bugs from the initial release, and working towards the final 2.0 update - a full graphical overhaul with some other unannounced content.<br>
To limit liability and respect the DMCA, we only distribute patches that are applied to AM2R 1.1 like a ROMhack. Our AM2RLauncher application automates this process for easy installation and updates.</p>

<h4 id=how-do-i-install-the-latest-version-on-linux>How do I install the latest version on Linux?</h4>
<h6 id=flatpak--steam-deck>Flatpak / Steam Deck</h6>
<p>For a universal Linux install without the need to install any dependencies, or for Steam Deck users, you can choose to use the Flatpak version of the AM2RLauncher.</p>
<ol>
 <li>Follow the instructions for your Distro to install <a href=https://flatpak.org/setup/>Flatpak</a> if don’t have it installed already. Steam Deck users can skip this step.</li>
 <li>Install the <a href=https://flathub.org/apps/details/io.github.am2r_community_developers.AM2RLauncher>AM2RLauncher Flatpak</a>. This may be from the linked site, or your software center, such as Discover on the Steam Deck.</li>
 <li>Launch the AM2RLauncher, and follow the instructions from “Install Community Updates” further down.</li>
</ol>
<h6 id=native-install>Native install</h6>
<p>First you need to download the right dependencies: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.NET Runtime</code> (6.0 or higher), <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">xdelta3</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gtk3</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">libappindicator3</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">webkitgtk</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">openssl</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fuse2</code>. In addition, you also need the following dependencies for AM2R itself: Multilib / 32-Bit architecture added, and the <strong>32-Bit version</strong> of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">libpulse</code>.<br>
A detailed installation for each distribution with commands is available on the <a href=https://github.com/AM2R-Community-Developers/AM2RLauncher/wiki/Installation-Process>GitHub Wiki</a> page.</p>
<p>After that, you need to download and start the AM2RLauncher:</p>
<ol>
 <li>Head to the AM2RLauncher download page, download the Linux version and unzip the file to its own folder: <a href=https://github.com/AM2R-Community-Developers/AM2RLauncher/releases/latest>https://github.com/AM2R-Community-Developers/AM2RLauncher/releases/latest</a></li>
 <li>Make sure that you have the following dependencies for the AM2RLauncher installed:</li>
 <li>Mark <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">AM2RLauncher.Gtk</code> as an executable, and then run it. This can be done like this: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">chmod +x AM2RLauncher.Gtk</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">./AM2RLauncher</code>. Alternatively, if your desktop environment supports it, you can also double-click on the file after it has been marked as an executable.</li>
 <li>Follow the instructions from “Install Community Updates” further down.</li>
</ol>
<h6 id=install-community-updates>Install Community Updates</h6>
<ol>
 <li>Click on the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Download</code> button and let it download the necessary patch files.</li>
 <li>Click on the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Select 1.1</code> button and select your copy of AM2R 1.1 and let the AM2RLauncher verify it.</li>
 <li>Click on the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Install</code> button.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id=how-do-i-make-sure-the-am2rlauncher-will-update-my-copy-of-am2r-11>How do I make sure the AM2RLauncher will update my copy of AM2R 1.1?</h4>
<p>The AM2RLauncher will make sure that your copy is legitimate.</p>
<h4 id=help-the-am2rlauncher-gave-me-an-error-code-when-putting-in-11>Help! The AM2RLauncher gave me an error code when putting in 1.1!</h4>
<p>There are a series of return codes the AM2RLauncher will give you if your copy of 1.1 is incorrect. Here’s what they mean:</p>
<ul>
 <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MissingOrInvalidAM2RExe</code>: AM2R.exe is not from 1.1.</li>
 <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MissingOrInvalidD3DX9_43Dll</code>: D3DX9_43.dll is not from 1.1.</li>
 <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MissingOrInvalidDataWin</code>: data.win is not from 1.1.<br>
Note: If you got one of the above codes, you may be trying to give the AM2RLauncher 1.0 or one of the newer Community Updates. These will not work.</li>
 <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GameIsInASubfolder</code>: The zip is improperly packaged. The game files should be in the root of the zip, not within a subfolder.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id=how-do-i-install-the-latest-version-on-android>How do I install the latest version on Android?</h4>
<p>The AM2RLauncher cannot be run on Android. Instead, you must use the Windows or Linux AM2RLauncher to create an Android APK to install.<br>
After following the installation instructions for Windows or Linux, ensure that you have the latest Java runtime installed and then click the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Create APK</code> button.<br>
The resulting file can be transferred onto your Android device however you desire, and can then be installed like any other APK.<br>
There is a way to create the APK on your Android device without the AM2RLauncher, but please only do this if you <strong>absolutely have no access to <em>any</em> PC</strong>.</p>
<h4 id=i-have-no-access-to-any-pc-how-do-i-install-the-latest-version-on-android>I have no access to any PC, how do I install the latest version on Android?</h4>
<ol>
 <li>Place your copy of AM2R 1.1 into your Downloads folder and make sure it’s named like this: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">AM2R_11.zip</code> (case sensitive).</li>
 <li>Download and install Termux (preferably from F-Droid, not the Google Play Store as those builds are not official). You can find download links for that here: <a href=https://f-droid.org/packages/com.termux/>https://f-droid.org/packages/com.termux/</a><br>
Just scroll down, you don’t need to download the F-Droid Store. Download and install the Termux APK for the latest version.</li>
 <li>Open Termux, let it set up, and then paste this command in there:<br>
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pkg install wget &amp;&amp; wget -O patcher.sh https://github.com/AM2R-Community-Developers/AM2R-Autopatcher-Android/raw/main/patcher.sh &amp;&amp; chmod +x patcher.sh &amp;&amp; ./patcher.sh</code></li>
 <li>In the middle of the patching process, it will ask you once if you want the high quality music or not. It is generally recommeneded to <strong><em>not</em></strong> download it, as it is ~230MB big and can cause mobile devices to lag, but if you really wish to have it the option is there for you.</li>
 <li>Wait for the patching process to complete.</li>
 <li>When it’s done, it will save the APK to your Downloads folder and automatically prompt you to open the APK. Simply choose your system’s APK/package installer for this.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id=the-am2rlauncher-takes-a-long-time-to-download-the-update-files-is-this-normal>The AM2RLauncher takes a long time to download the update files. Is this normal?</h4>
<p>Yes. Depending on your internet speed and your download mirror’s speed, this may take a while. You can try changing your mirror by going to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Download Mirror</code> dropdown in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Options</code> tab and seeing if that gets you a better speed.</p>
<h4 id=ive-encountered-an-issue-with-the-am2rlauncher-what-do-i-do>I’ve encountered an issue with the AM2RLauncher. What do I do?</h4>
<p>You can ask for support in the communication channels listed above. Please provide relevant system information, steps you took, and the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">AM2RLauncher.log</code> file which can be found in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Logs</code> folder.<br>
On Linux, the Logs folder will be found in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~/.local/share/AM2RLauncher</code> instead, or for Flatpak/Steam Deck users in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~/.var/app/io.github.am2r_community_developers.AM2RLauncher/data/AM2RLauncher</code>.<br>
If you encountered a bug with the Launcher itself or something where support cannot help you, open an issue at the AM2RLauncher GitHub page.</p>

</ol>
<p>If you have mods installed, this needs to be done for every one of them individually.</p>
<p>Additionally, we cannot guarantee future support for Windows 8, as official support for the operating system ended in 2016.</p>
<h4 id=how-do-i-install-mods>How do I install mods?</h4>
<ol>
 <li>Download the .zip file of the mod you want to play.</li>
 <li>Open the AM2RLauncher and click on the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Mod Settings</code> Tab.</li>

<h4 id=i-am-on-linux-and-i-dont-want-to-use-the-am2rlauncher-what-do-i-do-instead>I am on Linux and I don’t want to use the AM2RLauncher. What do I do instead?</h4>
<p>This is not recommended, due to you missing out on automatic release updates, mod support, and easier use. However, the legacy installer can be found here:<br>
<a href=https://github.com/AM2R-Community-Developers/AM2R-Autopatcher-Linux>https://github.com/AM2R-Community-Developers/AM2R-Autopatcher-Linux</a><br>
Again, it is not recommended to use the manual installation. For help, please use our GitHub issues page or our communication channels.</p>
<h4 id=i-am-using-manjaro-and-am2r-doesnt-run-how-do-i-fix-this>I am using Manjaro, and AM2R doesn’t run. How do I fix this?</h4>
<p>Unfortunately, we have been unable to figure out why AM2R will not run on Manjaro. Insights are greatly appreciated at our GitHub issues page or our communication channels.</p>
<h2 id=controller-questions>Controller Questions</h2>
<h4 id=which-controllers-does-am2r-support>Which controllers does AM2R support?</h4>
<p>Every controller that your operating system natively supports <em>should</em> work. Bluetooth support is not guaranteed; if you are having issues after checking the rest of this section, please try using a wired connection.</p>
<h4 id=i-am-on-windows-and-have-trouble-getting-my-switch-pro-controller-to-work-what-do-i-do>I am on Windows and have trouble getting my Switch Pro Controller to work, what do I do?</h4>
<p>The Switch Pro Controller is not natively supported by Windows. You need to use a separate program in order to get it recognized, like BetterJoy or Steam.</p>
<h4 id=the-d-pad-on-my-dualshock-4-controller-is-not-working>The D-Pad on my Dualshock 4 controller is not working!</h4>
<p>The Dualshock 4’s D-Pad won’t work with AM2R, due to Sony making it act as an analogue stick internally and the DS4 not being natively supported by Windows. You need to use a seperate program that converts DInput to XInput, like DS4Windows or Steam - or you can just play without the D-Pad.</p>
<h4 id=i-am-on-linux-and-my-controllers-dont-work>I am on Linux and my controllers don’t work!</h4>
<ol>
 <li>Check first if enabling <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Compatibility Mode</code> in the Control options and restarting AM2R fixes the issue.</li>
 <li>GameMaker: Studio 1.4 recommends the following dependencies, try to see if installing them fixes it: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jstest-gtk</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">joystick</code>.</li>
 <li>If all fails, ask in our communication channels for more help.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id=how-do-i-get-a-controller-connected-to-my-android-device>How do I get a controller connected to my Android device?</h4>
<p>Either connect the controller via Bluetooth (check the manual for your phone and controller) or plug it in via a cable (if your controller/phone supports it). Bluetooth is not recommended for the DS4, as it is known to lag on some Android installations.</p>
<h2 id=display-questions>Display Questions</h2>
<h4 id=whats-am2rs-native-resolution>What’s AM2R’s native resolution?</h4>
<p>AM2R’s native resolution is 320x240 in 4:3 or 426x240 in 16:9.</p>
<h4 id=how-do-you-change-the-games-resolution>How do you change the game’s resolution?</h4>
<p>You can change the game resolution by going into <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Options</code> -&gt; <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Display Options</code> and changing the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Window Scale</code> option.</p>
<h4 id=how-do-you-change-the-aspect-ratio>How do you change the aspect ratio?</h4>
<p>In 1.5.1 and above, the aspect ratio can be toggled between 4:3 and 16:9 by going into <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Options</code> -&gt; <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Display Options</code> and toggling the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Widescreen</code> option. If you are in-game, this setting will require a room transition to take effect.</p>
<h4 id=i-am-on-linux-and-the-display-gets-stuckcorrupted-if-i-boot-from-fullscreen>I am on Linux and the display gets stuck/corrupted if I boot from fullscreen!</h4>
<p>Due to GameMaker: Studio 1.4 shenanigans, this can’t be fixed at the boot screen. From 1.5.3 and onwards it should be fixed once you reach the “A controller is recommended” screen.</p>
<h4 id=how-do-i-use-the-gameboy-filters>How do I use the GameBoy filters?</h4>
<p>The GameBoy color filters can be cycled in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Options</code> -&gt; <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Extras</code> menu or if you’re on a PC you can use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">F9</code>.</p>
<h4 id=how-do-i-use-filters-like-crt-scanlines-or-xbrz>How do I use filters like CRT, scanlines, or XBRZ?</h4>
<p>Except for the GameBoy filters, AM2R does not provide any in-game filters. On Windows you can use an application called ReShade to use custom filters (the game uses D3DX9), but it is not officially supported and we can’t answer any support questions you have about it.</p>
<h2 id=general-game-questions>General Game Questions</h2>
<h4 id=how-many-difficulties-are-there-and-what-are-the-differences-between-them>How many difficulties are there, and what are the differences between them?</h4>
<p>There are 4 difficulties in AM2R: Easy, Normal, Hard and Fusion. Their features are as follows:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Normal is the difficulty the game is primarily balanced around. It is recommended for first-time players.</li>
 <li>In Easy, you take half of Normal damage.</li>
 <li>In Hard, some enemies have enhanced behavior, you take 2x Normal damage, and have reduced ammo pickup counts (2 Missiles/1 Super Missile/1 Power Bomb per tank instead of 5/2/2).</li>
 <li>In Fusion, all Hard changes apply with 4x Normal damage, Fusion Suit graphics, X Parasites spawning instead of health/ammo pickups from organic enemies, and Core-X spawning as a final phase for organic or semi-organic bosses.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id=i-dont-see-the-fusion-difficulty-how-do-i-unlock-it>I don’t see the Fusion difficulty. How do I unlock it?</h4>
<p>In order to unlock Fusion difficulty you need to beat the game once with a 100% item completion or use the cheat code described below.</p>
<h4 id=i-already-beat-the-game-once-andor-want-to-jump-straight-into-the-other-gamemodes-how-can-i-unlock-the-other-gamemodes>I already beat the game once and/or want to jump straight into the other gamemodes. How can I unlock the other gamemodes?</h4>
<p>If you’re at the file select screen, you can input this cheat code to unlock the extra gamemodes:<br>
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[UP][UP][DOWN][DOWN][LEFT][RIGHT][LEFT][RIGHT][ACCEPT][BACK]</code><br>
A sound will play if you input the code successfully.</p>
<h4 id=i-want-to-start-the-game-with-the-hatchling-how-do-i-unlock-it>I want to start the game with the Hatchling. How do I unlock it?</h4>
<p>If you’re at the file select screen, you can input this cheat code to unlock the Hatchling:<br>
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[UP][LEFT][DOWN][RIGHT][RIGHT][DOWN][LEFT][UP]</code><br>
A sound will play if you input the code successfully.<br>
This cheat does not affect gameplay and is purely cosmetic.</p>
<h4 id=how-many-gamemodes-are-there-and-what-is-the-difference-between-them>How many gamemodes are there and what is the difference between them?</h4>
<p>There are 3 gamemodes: New Game, New Game+ and Random Game+. New Game+ and Random Game+ must be unlocked by beating the game once. The features are as follows:</p>
<ul>
 <li>New Game is the normal adventure.</li>
 <li>New Game+ makes the game less linear by lowering the lava to just before the Nest, giving you immediate access to every area up until Area 5 (the Distribution Center). The bomb blocks between Area 1 and Area 2 have been removed to open early game progression further.</li>
 <li>Random Game+ randomizes item locations. All New Game+ changes apply. More intermediate skills like Wall Jumping and Infinite Bomb Jumping are recommended, and sometimes necessary. In order to minimize softlocking, the first Super Missile and Power Bomb locations are not randomized, enemies will drop Power Bomb drops if you do not have Bombs yet, some passages have been cleared already, some block weaknesses have changed to normal Shoot Blocks, and Septoggs will help you reach greater heights. While this mode minimizes softlocks, they <em>can still happen</em>, so save often.<br>
There are also 3 different Random Game+ types, which are:
 <ul>
 <li>Classic Mode:
 <ul>
 <li>Power-ups Only: Only power-ups are randomized, with a guarantee of Bombs being present in Area 1.</li>
 <li>Starting Paths: There are two different item pools, expansions and power-ups. The location for Bombs in Golden Temple will be either Bombs, Power Bombs or Screw Attack. The bomb blocks between Area 1 and Area 2 have been brought back for stricter path enforcement.</li>
 </ul>
 </li>
 <li>Split Random: There are two different item pools, expansions and power-ups. Expansions can be any expansion, and power-ups can be any power-up.</li>
 <li>AM2Random: Expansions and power-ups are fully randomized together.</li>
 </ul>
 </li>
</ul>
<h4 id=im-stuck-in-random-game-how-do-i-proceed>I’m stuck in Random Game+! How do I proceed?</h4>
<p>Check first if you truly are stuck, you may have missed a path or an item somewhere.<br>
Otherwise, post your <strong>seed</strong>, <strong>game mode</strong> and <strong>operating system</strong> into our communication channels for people to help you!</p>
<h4 id=what-is-the-rock-platform-with-wings-and-eyes-and-what-does-it-do>What is the rock-platform with wings and eyes, and what does it do?</h4>
<p>The Septoggs were creatures found in the original M:II as platforms to help with Space Jumping. We wanted to include them along with the Blob Throwers to complete the enemy roster from the original game, but had to come up with another purpose for them to work besides simple floating platforms. <br>
They do help the player, which is most noticeable in Random Game+, but they also act as environmental story telling akin to the Zebesian Roaches and Tatori from Super Metroid. This can be seen with the Baby Septoggs randomly appearing in certain areas with camouflage of that environment and more and more babies appearing by husks in the breeding grounds as the game progresses.</p>
<h4 id=what-is-insanity-mode>What is Insanity Mode?</h4>
<p>A red save file indicates Insanity Mode. It can be toggled in the Gameplay menu, and changes the following:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Saving is disabled.</li>
 <li>You get power bomb drops for the length of the game.</li>
 <li>Reactor E-Tank is guaranteed.</li>
 <li>No miniboss or spike plant drops in Hard and Fusion difficulties.</li>
 <li>No easy helper Septoggs in Random Game+.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id=what-is-the-maximum-amount-of-pickups-i-can-collect>What is the maximum amount of pickups I can collect?</h4>
<p>The maximum collection is 10 E-Tanks, 44 Missile Expansions, 10 Super Missile Expansions, and 10 Power Bomb Expansions. This leads to a total of 1099 health, 250 Missiles, 20 Super Missiles and 20 Power Bombs on Normal, and on Hard and higher to 1099 health, 118 Missiles, 10 Super Missiles and 10 Power Bombs.</p>
<h4 id=how-do-i-translate-the-last-log>How do I translate the last log?</h4>
<p>It will be automatically translated before the game ends after you reach the surface.</p>
<h4 id=how-many-ending-images-are-there-and-how-do-i-unlock-them>How many ending images are there, and how do I unlock them?</h4>
<p>There are 3 endings:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Ending 1: If you’re playing on Easy, or you’re playing on a higher difficulty but your completion time is over 4 hours.</li>
 <li>Ending 2: If you’re playing on Normal or higher and your completion time is less than 4 hours.</li>
 <li>Ending 3: If you’re playing on Normal or higher and your completion time is less than 2 hours.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=save-questions>Save Questions</h2>
<h4 id=i-still-have-an-old-version-of-am2r-installed-will-updating-it-delete-my-saves>I still have an old version of AM2R installed, will updating it delete my saves?</h4>
<p>No, updating AM2R or switching to the AM2RLauncher will not delete your saves, those are kept completely seperate.<br>
However, loading old saves in a new version may make it unsafe to load them in old versions of the game again! If you’re worried, make backups before updating.</p>
<h4 id=where-can-i-find-my-saves-on-windows>Where can I find my saves on Windows?</h4>
<p>Saves are located in:<br>
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">C:\Users\[Your User Name]\AppData\Local\AM2R</code><br>
If you use the AM2RLauncher, you can go to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Mod Settings</code> tab, and click on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Open Profile Save Folder</code> to quickly open that directory.</p>
<h4 id=where-can-i-find-my-saves-on-linux>Where can I find my saves on Linux?</h4>
<p>Saves are located in:<br>
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~/.config/AM2R</code><br>
If you use the AM2RLauncher, you can go to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Mod Settings</code> tab, and click on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Open Profile Save Folder</code> to quickly open that directory.</p>
<h4 id=where-can-i-find-my-saves-on-android>Where can I find my saves on Android?</h4>
<p>In order to access your saves on Android, you need to have root access. After that, you can find your saves in one of these locations depending on your version:<br>
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/data/data/com.companyname.AM2RWrapper/files</code><br>
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/data/data/com.lojical.AM2R/files/</code></p>
<h4 id=are-saves-cross-platform>Are saves cross-platform?</h4>
<p>Yes, saves are cross-platform.</p>
<h4 id=can-i-use-save-files-from-earlier-versions>Can I use save files from earlier versions?</h4>
<p>Yes, but compatibility is not guaranteed. See questions above to where saves are located.<br>
1.0/1.1 saves use the filename savN.<br>
1.5+ saves use the filename saveN.<br>
Some older Community Update saves use the filename saveXN.<br>
N is either 1, 2 or 3, depending on the save slot.</p>
<h2 id=windows-specific-questions>Windows Specific Questions</h2>
<h4 id=am2r-doesnt-show-on-the-taskbar>AM2R doesn’t show on the Taskbar!</h4>
<p>This is an issue with GameMaker: Studio 1.4. To fix it, Alt-Tab out and back into the game.</p>
<h4 id=i-have-trouble-streaming-am2r-in-discord>I have trouble streaming AM2R in Discord!</h4>
<p>Discord sometimes has trouble picking up other games - particularly if they’re fullscreen.
You can try to:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Alt-Tab out and back in and see if Discord recognizes the game.</li>
 <li>Add AM2R as a game manually, by going to your User Settings.</li>
 <li>Disable fullscreen on AM2R.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id=am2r-runs-slow-on-windows-way-slower-than-previous-versions>AM2R runs slow on Windows! Way slower than previous versions!</h4>
<p>YoYo Games made changes to some Windows-specific behavior that cause it to run slow on certain setups.<br>
To fix this, you may need to change the SleepMargin value in options.ini - higher values will take up more CPU cycles but will be less prone to the slowdown.<br>
If you are confused about this issue, please ask in our communication channels for help.</p>
<h4 id=my-custom-palette--the-8-bit-shader-doesnt-appear>My custom palette / the 8-bit shader doesn’t appear!</h4>
<p>AM2R requires DirectX9.0 installed and hardware shader support to properly display some palette changes in Fusion difficulty, allow the 8-bit shader to work, and enable custom palettes.<br>
Until DirectX9.0 is installed and the shaders properly compile, the above mentioned features will not work properly.<br>
The required DirectX version (June 2010) can be found on Microsoft’s website here:<br>
<a href=https://download.microsoft.com/download/8/4/A/84A35BF1-DAFE-4AE8-82AF-AD2AE20B6B14/directx_Jun2010_redist.exe>https://download.microsoft.com/download/8/4/A/84A35BF1-DAFE-4AE8-82AF-AD2AE20B6B14/directx_Jun2010_redist.exe</a></p>
<p>Additionally, the repalette shader will <em>not</em> apply to the M:SR Fusion Suit variant. It will only recolor the Fusion Suit on the default setting. This can be accessed in the Extras menu.</p>
<p>A final note: some graphics cards simply will not support the repalette shader.</p>
<h4 id=how-can-i-make-am2r-on-windows-portable>How can I make AM2R on Windows portable?</h4>
<p>In order to make AM2R portable, create the following files in the asset folder (the folder containing AM2R.exe and data.win):</p>
<ul>
 <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">save1</code> through <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">save3</code></li>
 <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">config.ini</code></li>
 <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">extras.sav</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Please note that this is not officially supported, and is merely an exploitable quirk of GameMaker: Studio 1.4’s file detection.</p>

 <li>Make sure that you installed the .NET Core runtime. Open a terminal, and type in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dotnet --info</code>. If the command doesn’t error <em>and</em> you have <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Microsoft.NET.CORE.App</code> with a version newer than 5.0 you installed it correctly.</li>
 <li>Make sure you <em>don’t</em> install the .NET Core runtime via Snap. If you did install it via Snap, uninstall it and install it following Microsoft’s instructions.</li>
</ol>
<p>Microsoft’s instructions for installing .NET Core can be found here:<br>

<h4 id=i-have-an-nvidia-gpu-with-proprietary-drivers-and-the-game-doesnt-launch>I have an Nvidia GPU with proprietary drivers and the game doesn’t launch!</h4>
<p>Update to the AM2RLauncher 2.2.0 or later, as this problem is fixed there!<br>
Otherwise, make sure that you have the 32-bit version of your drivers installed first.<br>
Then in the AM2RLauncher, go to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Options</code> tab, and use the LD_PRELOAD environment variable that points to your OpenGL drivers.<br>
If you’re on Ubuntu, this will probably look like this <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libGL.so.1</code>, if you’re on Arch, it’ll look like this <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib32/libGL.so</code>.<br>
It may look different on other distros. If you have to use a different flag for a different distro, please let us know in our communication channels so we can include it here!</p>
<h4 id=i-have-an-amd-gpu-and-the-game-doesnt-launch>I have an AMD GPU and the game doesn’t launch!</h4>
<p>Update to the AM2RLauncher 2.2.0 or later, as this problem is fixed there!<br>
Otherwise, make sure that you have the 32-bit version of your drivers installed first.<br>
Then in the AM2RLauncher, go to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Options</code> tab, and use one of the following environment variables: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">radeonsi_sync_compile=true</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">R600_DEBUG=mono</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">R600_DEBUG=vs.ps</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">R600_DEBUG=check_vm</code>.<br>
It’s not a guarantee which one will work, so you’ll likely have to try them all.</p>

<h4 id=how-do-i-use-custom-fonts>How do I use custom fonts?</h4>
<p>AM2R uses five different fonts; raw .ttf font files of the exact fonts used in AM2R have been included in the ‘lang/fonts’ folder. Two of these fonts (Glasstown NBP and uni 05_53) include nearly a thousand new glyphs that allow AM2R to be translated into many non-Latin languages, particularly for log messages and various descriptions.<br>
The other three fonts (mainly used for GUI elements and titles) do not include as many glyphs but these font files can also be updated to include more characters; this will not be described here in detail, but the recommended process is to create the new letters in BitFontMaker2 and add the letters to the included .ttf files with FontForge. Both applications are free software.</p>
<h4 id=how-do-i-use-custom-music>How do I use custom music?</h4>
<p>Simply go to the main game folder and replace the song of your choice with another .ogg file.</p>
<h4 id=how-do-i-use-custom-sound-effects>How do I use custom sound effects?</h4>
<p>Replacing sound effects is not possible, unless you’re modding the game - in which case you should consult the GameMaker: Studio 1.4 or UndertaleModTool documentation.</p>

 <ul>
 <li>Depleted E-Tanks - You may change how much energy E-Tanks hold in modifiers.ini.</li>
 <li>You may start with 0 through 30 missiles on game start.</li>
 <li>You can change damage taken from plants and lava.</li>
 </ul>
 </li>
 <li>Randomizer seed - You may manually set the randomizer seed in modifiers.ini. This is also available in the Gameplay menu in-game.</li>
 <li>Boss and some enemy health - You may manually set the health of bosses in modifiers.ini. You may only increase their health.</li>
 <li>Boss and some enemy damage dealt - You may manually set the damage you receive from bosses in modifiers.ini. You may only increase this damage.</li>
