/ Appendix A: Objects

For multiple chat commands, you may provide an object name. Object names consist
of characters (case-insensitive) and digits and may not contain spaces.

In many cases you can also supply multiple objects at once by separating them
with "|" symbol, e.g. "snake|bat". Depending on context, such combinations of
objects will be either recognized as list (meaning that action will be applied
to each of them) or a set to choose from (meaning that one of objects will be
picked at random).

If you are familiar with modding of original game, you can use object names as
they are defined in source. Otherwise, a comprehensive list is available below
(beware of brief spoilers, if anything!):
 _______________
