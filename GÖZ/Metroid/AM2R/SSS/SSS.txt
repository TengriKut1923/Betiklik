FAQ
- Where are my screenshots? I can't find them anymore!
Look in your AppData/Local folder, it's usually in this location:
C:\Users\[Your User Name]\AppData\Local\AM2R

For Linux, it can be found at this location:
/home/[Your User Name]/.config/AM2R

- Why are my screenshots so big?
The screenshots are now taken with the size of the displayed window.
If you want the classic 320x240 screenshots, set the display to Windowed 1x
before pressing F12.

- Can I use save files from demos before 1.0?
No. The game has changed a lot since the demo, along with the save format.

- Can I use save files from versions before 1.4.3?
Yes, but compatability is not guaranteed. Saves are located in C:\Users\[Your User Name]\AppData\Local\AM2R.
1.0/1.1 saves use the filename savN.
1.5+ saves use the filename saveN.
Some older Community Update saves use the filename saveXN.

- I have an Arcade cabinet, can I exit AM2R with just 1 key?
Sure! After running the game once, go to this folder:
C:\Users\[Your User Name]\AppData\Local\AM2R
And edit config.ini, setting the following values:
EnableExitButton=1 (should be 0 by default)
KeyboardButtonExit, JoystickButtonExit and XBJoypadButtonExit can be used to
customize which button / key is used to exit. Default is ESC for keyboard,
Back for XInput, and button 10 for DirectInput.

FAQ Continued Revisions
- Did DoctorM64 have anything to do with this?
DoctorM64 has nothing to do with this. He did not supply the source code.

- How did you get the source code for AM2R?
https://gitlab.com/users/yellowafterlife/projects

- The Fusion suit doesn't change colors for the different types. Help!
AM2R requires DirectX9.0 installed and hardware shader support to properly 
display art in Fusion mode, allow the 8-bit shader to work, and enable custom 
palettes. Until DirectX9.0 is installed and the shaders properly compile, you 
will see the message displayed on the titlescreen and the above mentioned 
features will not work properly.

The required DirectX version (June 2010) can be found on Microsoft's website here:

- Will you add Ridley?
...

- Will you add new areas or powerups?
No. The development team believes that the world of AM2R is complete, and we are 
focusing on improving what exists rather than adding totally new content.

- What's the most up-to-date version?
The latest version of AM2R will always be posted at www.reddit.com/r/AM2R and will
automatically be installed if you are using the AM2RLauncher.

- What platforms is AM2R available on?
Currently, AM2R runs natively on Windows, Android, and Linux platforms.
Linux support is provided as-is and is not guaranteed to run on any given machine.
AM2R is capable of running on older Mac devices using Wine.

- Will you release the source code?
It's public! Check out the AM2R-Community-Updates repository on GitHub.

- How do I load custom title images/backgrounds/area intros?

Title images: Place your custom image within the /lang/titles/ folder. It must use the following name format: 'language_x000_y000.png'.
	- Replace 'language' with the same name as the language file you use. This is the name in the file header, not the filename. 
	- Replace '000' after both 'x' and 'y' with the necessary coordinate offsets. 
	- For example, a valid title file might be named 'english_x048_y032.png'
	- If you need a negative 'x' title offset (for say, widescreen) simply add a minus sign in front of the 'x' coordinate: 'language_-x000_y000.png'.
	
Backgrounds: Place your custom image in the same folder as your AM2R datafile. (AM2R.exe on Windows, game.unx on Linux) It must use the following name format: 'titlebackground_f00_s00.png'
	- Replace the '00' after 'f' with the number of frames in the background image.
	- Replace the '00' after 's' with the frame-per-second speed of the animation.
	- For example, a valid background file might be named 'titlebackground_f01_s60.png'

Area intros: Place your custom sprite strip within the /lang/headers/ folder. It must use the following name format: language_a0_f00_b00_c00_d00_e00.png
	- Replace the '0' after 'a' with the area ID.
		- 1. Golden Temple
		- 2. Hydro Station
		- 3. Industrial Complex
		- 4. The Tower
		- 5. Distribution Center
		- 6. [has no intro]
		- 7. Genetics Lab
		- 8. GFS Thoth
	- Replace the '00' after 'f' with the number of frames in your sprite.
	- Replace the '00' after 'b', 'c', 'd', and 'e' with each of the 4 pause frame indices in the sprite.
	- For example, a valid English A1 intro file might be named 'english_a1_f24_b00_c03_d19_e21.png'
