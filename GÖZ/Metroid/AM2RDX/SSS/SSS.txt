- Why are my screenshots so big?

The screenshots are now taken with the size of the displayed window.
If you want the classic 320x240 screenshots, set the display to Windowed 1x
before pressing F12.

- I have an Arcade cabinet, can I exit AM2R with just 1 key?

Sure! After running the game once, go to this folder:
C:\Users\[Your User Name]\AppData\Local\AM2R
And edit config.ini, setting the following values:
EnableExitButton=1 (should be 0 by default)
KeyboardButtonExit, JoystickButtonExit and XBJoypadButtonExit can be used to
customize which button / key is used to exit. Default is ESC for keyboard,
Back for XInput, and button 10 for DirectInput.

- How do I load custom title images/backgrounds/area intros?

Title images: Place your custom image within the /lang/titles/ folder. It must use the following name format: 'language_x000_y000.png'.
	- Replace 'language' with the same name as the language file you use. This is the name in the file header, not the filename. 
	- Replace '000' after both 'x' and 'y' with the necessary coordinate offsets. 
	- For example, a valid title file might be named 'english_x048_y032.png'
	- If you need a negative 'x' title offset (for say, widescreen) simply add a minus sign in front of the 'x' coordinate: 'language_-x000_y000.png'.
	
Backgrounds: Place your custom image in the same folder as your AM2R datafile. (AM2R.exe on Windows, game.unx on Linux) It must use the following name format: 'titlebackground_f00_s00.png'
	- Replace the '00' after 'f' with the number of frames in the background image.
	- Replace the '00' after 's' with the frame-per-second speed of the animation.
	- For example, a valid background file might be named 'titlebackground_f01_s60.png'

Area intros: Place your custom sprite strip within the /lang/headers/ folder. It must use the following name format: language_a0_f00_b00_c00_d00_e00.png
	- Replace the '0' after 'a' with the area ID.
		- 1. Golden Temple
		- 2. Hydro Station
		- 3. Industrial Complex
		- 4. The Tower
		- 5. Distribution Center
		- 6. [has no intro]
		- 7. Genetics Lab
		- 8. GFS Thoth
	- Replace the '00' after 'f' with the number of frames in your sprite.
	- Replace the '00' after 'b', 'c', 'd', and 'e' with each of the 4 pause frame indices in the sprite.
	- For example, a valid English A1 intro file might be named 'english_a1_f24_b00_c03_d19_e21.png'

- How do I use external font files?

AM2R uses five different fonts; raw .ttf font files of the exact fonts used in AM2R have been included 
in the 'fonts' folder of the language folder of AM2R. Two of these fonts (Glasstown NBP and uni 05_53)
include nearly a thousand new glyphs that allow AM2R to be translated into many non-Latin languages,
particularly for log messages and various descriptions. The other three fonts (mainly used for GUI elements
and titles) do not include as many glyphs but these font files can also be updated to include more characters;
this will not be described here in detail, but the recommended process is to create the new letters
in BitFontMaker2 and add the letters to the included .ttf files with FontForge, both are free software.
