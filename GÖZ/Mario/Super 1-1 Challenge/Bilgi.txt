The Super 1-1 Challenge is a time trial FPS where the goal is to reach the end of the course, finding all golden coins and all hidden red coins in the fastest time possible.

-----------------------------------------

Instructions:

Make your way to the flag defeating as many Goombas as possible as well as collecting as many coins as you can. Share you scores with your friends!

You can collect coins by either running into them, hitting them out of ? blocks or shooting them with a plunger.

You can defeat Goombas by stomping on them or shooting them with a plunger. Be careful not to get too close or you will die. 

Your health is measured by the colour of your plunger;
"Brown" - 1/3
"Red" - 2/3
"Black" 3/3

Every time you take damage you lose a health point and return to the previous colour. You can upgrade your plunger colour by finding super mushrooms in ? boxes.
